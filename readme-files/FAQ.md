### Q. Emulator X games are not being detected correctly
**A.** Read the Manual. *Right Click => Help*. It explains few things you can do. Gaming Gaiden uses simple command line to detect emulator and roms used. You should be able to fix it yourself. 

If you have tried what is explained in manual and believe it is a genuine bug, please report and i will look into it if i am free. Also i don't have all emulators or roms so i simply may not be able to test / fix it. 

Please remember ***Open source softwares don't come with warranty or support.***

### Q. Why use Browser for UI?
**A.** Because i am not a windows GUI application developer. I needed to make a GUI with features like search, sorting, graphs. HTML and Javascript made it very quick to build them. Everyone has a browser and going with browser gives the print to PDF / Take long screenshots features. Share your Gaiden with others.

### Q. Why not a native executable using C#?
**A.** Because i am not a C# developer. Having a native executable would have been nice but the current system is fine for what it needs to do. I wanted to get the Job done and not keep slaving on coding. Maybe someday i will convert it into a C# native windows app. Right now i want to go back to playing games.
